FILE DETAILS:
- File: ${filename}
- MCP File Path: ${mcpFilePath}
- Available columns: ${headers.join(", ")}
- Total rows: ${currentData.length - 1} (excluding header)

USER REQUEST: "${userMessage}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the Excel MCP tools to perform the requested operation on the file at path "${mcpFilePath}"
2. Always use the exact filepath parameter: "${mcpFilePath}"
3. After performing operations, provide a clear, friendly explanation of what you did
4. If you made changes, describe the specific changes made
5. If you encountered any issues, explain them clearly
6. Be conversational and helpful in your response

IMPORTANT: Focus on explaining what you accomplished rather than technical details. Users want to know:
- What operation was performed
- What data was affected
- What the results mean
- Any next steps they might consider

Example good responses:
- "I've sorted your data by salary in descending order. The highest earner is now at the top with $95,000, and I can see you have 150 employees total."
- "I added a new 'Bonus' column and calculated 10% of each employee's salary. The bonuses range from $3,000 to $9,500."
- "I created a summary showing your top 5 customers by revenue. Microsoft leads with $2.3M in sales this quarter."

Work with the file and provide a helpful, conversational response about what you accomplished.`
