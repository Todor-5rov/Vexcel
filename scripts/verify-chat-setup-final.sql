-- Run this to verify everything is working correctly

-- 1. Check table structure
SELECT 
    'chat_messages structure' as info,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'chat_messages'
    AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check foreign key constraints
SELECT
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
    AND tc.table_name = 'chat_messages';

-- 3. Check RLS policies
SELECT 
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'chat_messages';

-- 4. Test basic functionality (should return empty results initially)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_messages,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT file_id) as unique_files
FROM chat_messages;

-- Success message
SELECT 'Chat persistence setup complete! âœ…' as status;
